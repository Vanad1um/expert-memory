1) We set our search string to "white+dress" and media type to "musicVideo"
We see the result which is JSON file that includes an object with its fields;
We see 4 different collections;

2) We change string to "white+dress+lana" which shows us only 1 object that meets our
search requirements;

3) Now we change search string to "lana+del+rey" and also change the media type to "music"
which shows us data of all of her music but it's limited by 20 results;
